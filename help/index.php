That's it! (<a href="#no-manual">Don't have an owner's manual?</a>)</p><p>Cars are designed by engineers. The information in your manual is based on their recommendations. Having your car serviced outside the Honda family causes problems.</p><p>Inexperienced or uninformed guys working at chain stores, telling you when to rotate your tires or change the oil, tend to oversell, throwing the maintenance sequence off. This <em>costs you money</em>, and it doesn't do your car any good, either.</p><p>Honestly, <strong>everything</strong> you need to know is in the owner's manual. The reason your owner's manual is long, and tedious, is because it covers every nuance of every situation in order to avoid legal responsibility for sins of omission.</p><p>So here is my disclaimer: this is a quick guide, a number of practical <em>suggestions</em> for those occasions when you simply must take matters into your own hands, written in language you will understand. You can, and will, solve simple problems or avoid causing car damage, following my advice.</p><p>Finally, and I know this will hurt, but <em>you</em> have a responsibility to at least avoid <strong>three catastrophic situations</strong>:</p><ol>	<li><a href="#overheating">Don't let your engine over heat!</a></li>	<li><a href="#oil">Never, never, never run out of oil!</a></li>	<li><a href="#tires">Keep your tires properly inflated!</a></li></ol><p>This guide can help!</p><h2 id="no-manual">If you don't have an owners manual...</h2><p>You need to order one from a Honda dealer. It's simple. First, find your Vehicle Identification Number (or "VIN" as the guys call it). Stand at the driver's side of the front windshield and look down onto the interior dash. It is stamped in metal and has been entered into every car computer system on the planet. It is specific to your car and using it avoids ALL communication errors.</p><h2 id="self-service">User servicable parts</h2><p>You can replace some Honda parts yourself, like the gas cap, oil filter cap, light bulbs, wiper blades, wiper fluid, brake fluid etc. Order them through the Honda dealer using your VIN number. In Santa Barbara County, the Honda dealer's number is 681-1000. If traveling, call Honda of America at 1-888-444-6632.</p><h2 id="service">What and when is a service?</h2><p>You need to have you car <em>serviced</em> every 7,500 miles (or 10,000 miles in newer models). A service includes:</p><ul>	<li>oil change and new filter</li>	<li>replacement of all fluids (wiper, radiator, etc.)</li>	<li>tire rotation</li>	<li>tire air pressure</li>	<li>safety inspection (hoses, brakes, suspension, etc)</li>	<li>and more!</li></ul><p>Having your car serviced at these intervals means you <em>don't need to read any further</em>. Your Honda repairman will take care of everything, at competitive prices, because he wants you to return, a satisfied customer.</p><p>Driving styles and conditions can cause car parts to wear out of sync with your service. If you commit to having your car serviced at regular intervals, a good mechanic will include, on your receipt, those repairs which might be needed before your next service interval. He should be willing to show you the wear on parts and explain the urgency, or lack of urgency involved.</p><h2 id="gas">Gas</h2><p>Unless your manual or the sticker on the gas tank door recommends premium, use the least expensive fuel available. Using premium won't help your car run better. That is an urban myth. Ignore it.</p><p>You may hear a hissing sound when you unscrew the fuel cap. No worries, it's just air pressure escaping.</p><p>'Topping off' refers to adding fuel to the tank after the nozzle has clicked off. Don't do it. The tank needs space for fuel to expand with temperature variations.</p><p>Be sure to put the fuel cap on <em>tightly</em>, until it clicks. A loose cap can trigger the Malfunction Indicator Light on your instrument panel signaling a major problem when there is none.</p><p>Here's another urban myth you can ignore: You can't 'flood' your car by holding down the accelerator. The advent of fuel injection made this impossible.</p><h2 id="odometer">Odometer</h2><p>The odometer displays the number of miles the car has been driven. Checking tires and oil will depend on this number.</p><p>The odometer is located on the panel behind the steering wheel.</p><p>The 'trip meter' can be reset by pushing the little button next to it.This is great if you're following driving directions and need to know when you driven .9 miles, etc. You can re-set it over and over.</p><h2 id="tires">Tires</h2><p>Tire pressure is measured in pounds. The appropriate tire pressures for your vehicle are printed on a sticker on the driver's side door jam. The front tires look like they need more air because the weight of the car (the engine) is in the front. Check air pressure once a month at a gas station, or with a gauge that you purchase.</p><p>If your tires are worn unevenly, ask for a <em>wheel alignment</em>. If the car vibrates at certain speeds, you need to have the tires <em>balanced</em>.</p><p>When purchasing tires, the tire service will know the size your car needs. You tell them about how much you're willing to pay. Replace all four at the same time, or BOTH front tires or BOTH rear tires. Replacing only one tire effects how the car handles.</p><p>Changing a flat on the side of the road is dangerous. If you really want to do this, practice at home before you're in a desperate situation. The tools you'll need should be in your car. Your owner's manual has very specific instructions. <em>Wheel locks</em> are purchased to prevent tire theft but you need to know where they are when you have a flat tire, or not even a mechanic can remove the lug nuts.</p><h2 id="oil">Oil</h2><img id="dipstick" src="images/dipstick.gif" alt="dipstick" /><p>Change the oil every 7,500 miles OR every six months, which ever comes first. Checking the oil is <em>fun</em> and let's you feel very competent. Get a paper towel or rag, then lift the dipstick, a metal loop under the hood (the stick is on the end). Wipe the oil off the bottom of the stick and reinsert into the hole. Pull out the dipstick one more time and see how high the oil is on the stick. There are two lines (or two holes) at the base of the stick. If the oil is above the bottom line, everything is fine.</p><p>Replace dipstick, discard the towel or rag, and you're done!</p><p>The cap has "oil" written on it, and some indicate the kind of oil used. Generally, 5w-30w is recommended and can be purchased at grocery, drug, and automotive stores.</p><p>Purchasing oil additives is unnecessary and only increases your costs. If the oil pressure light comes on while driving, pull over, shut of engine and check oil. Add oil if indicated, then start motor and see if the light stays off. If the light is still on, there is a mechanical problem and the car should not be driven until repaired. Some of the caps for adding fluids have their name on them, just check, or peek at your manual.</p><h2 id="overheating">Overheating</h2><img id="heat-gauge" src="images/heat.gif" alt="heat" /><p>There is no temperature <em>light</em>, there is only a temperature <em>gauge</em>. <strong>Pull to the side of the road if the indicator moves into the red zone</strong>. You can destroy the motor if you continue driving!</p><p>If the gauge is in the red zone, pull over, leave the engine running then watch to see if it goes down. If it enters the normal zone, the car overheated from stress, such as climbing a steep hill on a hot day with the AC running. Continue driving AND checking the gauge periodically.</p><p>If there is smoke or steam, turn off the engine. <strong>Everything will be very hot, so BE CAREFUL, and use caution</strong>. Look for obvious leaks. They will need to be repaired before you can drive again. If there are no visible leaks, let gauge settle to the normal zone and check the radiator. Add water if it looks empty/dry. Start the engine. If the gauge rises to the red zone, turn off motor, the engine needs repair.</p><h2 id="brakes">Brakes</h2><p>Break failure is rare. When it happens, the brake pedal slowly moves to the floor while stopped, or when breaking while driving. Or, the car shudders when you apply the brakes. Or you hear a screeching noise from a wheel. Other clues might include the brake light (on the instrument panel behind the steering wheel) going on though the emergency brake is not engaged. Call your repairman if you experience theses symptoms.</p><p>If it is a brake fluid problem, you might <a href="#self-service">fix that yourself</a>.</p>The brake light has two functions. It indicates that the parking brake has been set OR that the brake fluid level is low. You can add brake fluid up to the MAX mark on the side of the reservoir. Only use Honda brake fluid with the DOT 3 or Dot 4 indicated. <strong>DOT 5 is incompatible</strong>. You need to have the system checked by a mechanic. The Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS) prevents wheels from locking and skidding. If the ABS system light comes on, the brakes will continue to work, but again, you should have them checked by a Honda mechanic. <h2 id="belt">Timing belt</h2><p>Timing belts are replaced with servicing. Failure causes catastrophic engine damage. If your car suddenly stops and won't re-start, you need a Honda mechanic.</p><h2 id="lights">Lights and indicators</h2><p>The yellow maintenance light on the dash is connected to the odometer. It lights to let you know it is time for your car to be serviced. It <em>does not</em> indicate eminent failure. It is re-set with each service.</p><p>The lights all come on briefly when you turn on the ignition, then shut off. Any lights reappearing while you're driving is a warning.</p><h2 id="battery">Battery</h2><p>The battery is connected to a charging system light on the instrument panel. If it comes on while driving, it means the battery is not getting charged. Shut off all electrical devices (AC, cruise control, defogger, etc). Keep the engine running and go to the nearest garage for help, or call your mechanic.</p><p>If your car won't start, the battery might be dead. Carrying a <em>battery jumper</em> can suddenly feel like the best purchase you've ever made. It can <em>jump start the battery</em>, has a <em>light</em> for nighttime emergencies, as well as an <em>air pressure system</em> for inflating tires. They cost between $50.00 - $60.00 where car accessories are sold. If you need a new battery, your Honda mechanic knows the appropriate size and capacity and can safely dispose of the old one.</p><h2 id="misc">Odds and ends...</h2><p>In no particular order:</p><ul>	<li>		<img id="defrost" src="images/defrost.gif" alt="defrost" />		<p>			Defrost by switching on the fan and pushing defrost the button.			Adjust the temperature control lever so air from vents feels warm.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		Fluids, like transmission, power steering, brake, differential and		coolant are best if purchased through the Honda dealer. If your car is		serviced regularly, you won't need these <strong>unless</strong> you		have a very old car. Then, you'll want to keep the fluids you might		need, in your trunk.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		Other smart items to carry with you: a flashlight, a battery jumper,		oil, rags or paper towels for checking oil, and a gallon of water for		potential radiator problems.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		If you've ever been stopped even once on the freeway for an extended		length of time, such that people are out of their cars, exchanging		business cards, and photos of their grandchildren, or if you've ever		broken down at night, you know how hard it can be. You can make a tough		situation mildly bearable by having a first aid kit, including rubber		gloves (bodily fluid protection in case of an accident) and a pain		reliever.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		Also useful are paper and pencils/pens to leave a note if the car		must be temporarily abandoned; drinking water and a snack that stores		well, like trail mix or granola bars; sunscreen, hats with brims,		sweatshirts, and a blanket, for all variety of weather.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		If you don't have a camera on your cell phone, a disposable camera for		taking photos of an accident scene, license plates, witnesses, or car		damage can beuseful.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		Windshield wipers are a safety issue not only when it rains, but for		cleaning the glass when you're driving into the sun at dusk with a dirty		window. Wiper fluid goes into the blue cap under the hood and can be		purchased at the gas station or a grocery store in an emergency.		Wipers can be purchased at auto parts stores and gas stations but are		tricky to install, though easy for a Honda mechanic, and come with a		service!		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		The hood, gas filler door and trunk latches are all on the floor by your		left leg when you're in the driver's sear. The hood loosens with the		floor pull, but for safety reasons you must run your finger under the		center of the hood until you feel the latch and push it open. Look for a		narrow, attached rod for bracing up the hood. It slips into one of the		holes under the hood's interior surface.		</p>	</li>	<li>		<p>		Warranties. New cars come with comprehensive warranties from the Honda		dealer. You can have your car serviced and repaired outside of the		dealership without loosing the warranty. Do a web search on "Honda		warranties" for answers to specific questions. Take questions,		compliments or complaints to the Bureau of Automotive Repairs, or your		local Better Business Bureau.		</p>	</li></ul><p>This ends my advice. I hope I've answered those frequently thought questions you've been too intimidated to ask. Remember, when in doubt, call a Honda repairman!</p><p><em>Conceived by Bruce Macintire, Master Honda Mechanic for thirty-six years.</em></p><p><em>Decoded from his abundantly complex brain by Peg Quinn.</em></p><p><em>Revised, edited and illustrated by Forrest Cameranesi.</em></p><?php include "../includes/footer.html"; ?>
